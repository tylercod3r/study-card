## overview

Looked for a "flash card" app that was free, and wouldn't couple me to a 3rd-party provider / plan.

Was unable to find anything suitable, so made this simple app!

## setup

- this is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

- make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.

1. download the project source:
   `git clone https://github.com/tylercod3r/study-card.git`

2. navigate to the project folder:
   `cd study-card`

3. install project dependencies:
   `npm install`

4. run the project:
   `npm run dev`

5. view in browser:
   `localhost:3000'

## use

- the app starts by loading a random 'question.'
- click the 'answer' button to toggle question responses.
- click the "next question" button to load a 'random' question.
- use the keyboard arrow keys to sequentially move through the questions.

## faq

Q: How do you edit or change the questions?

- edit the 'markdown' (.md) files found in:
  `/data/questions`

Q: The keyboard shortcuts don't seem to work?

- make sure you have the main section 'selected' by clicking any of the buttons.
